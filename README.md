# Nasa BearthDay Challenge

Note: 

Given more time I would have completed both bonus items. I was only able to complete one becuase I had decided to just use the JavaScript Date API which took some time to implement. Currently the slider for images is implemented.

I would also not commit API keys (used to get around cors issues) and hide them in environment variables. 

## To Run application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
