# Nasa BearthDay Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Given more time I would have completed both bonus items. I was only able to complete one becuase I had decided to just use the JavaScript Date API which took some time to implement. Currently the slider for images is implemented.
